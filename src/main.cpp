/*
 * ESP8266 Template
 * ==================
 *
 * Includes useful functions like
 * - DeepSleep
 * - Read VCC
 * - MQTT
 * - OTA Updates (ATTN: requires MQTT!)
 *
 * If you use DeepSleep, make sure to connect pin 16 (D0) to RESET, or your ESP will never wake up!
 * Also keep in mind that you can DeepSleep for ~ 1 hour max (hardware limitation)!
 *
 * ATTENTION: This sketch is optimized to receive subscribed MQTT topics as quickly as possible (to minimize runtime / maximize battery runtime).
 * This has the drawback, that we expect to receive a (retained) message for every subscribed topic. The sketch will run in an endless loop
 * if subscribing to an empty topic! See MqttUpdater function in common-functions.cpp!
 *
 * Keep in mind that you'll need a reliable power source for OTA updates, 2x AA batteries might not be sufficient.
 * If you brick your ESP during OTA update, you can probably revive it by flashing it wired.
